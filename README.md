# matrix-multiplication
A program that takes the rows and columns of two matrices, generates them, multiplies them and then calculates the error in the calculation returning success if the error is less than 1E-14. Not compatible with anything before C99.

Sample run:

./main                                    //Executing program. 
Enter m,n,p:10 15 20                      //m = rows of matrix A | n = Columns of A, rows of B | p = columns of B
Max error 0.0e+00
SUCCESS

./main
Enter m,n,p:200 243 535
Max error 0.0e+00
SUCCESS
